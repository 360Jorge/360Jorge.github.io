## Introduction

The middle-thirds Cantor topological space, endowed with the subspace topology, is homeomorphic to the countable product of the set $$\{0, 1\}$$, endowed with the discrete topology.

Proving the above fact is the purpose of my topology class. We are writing a book [Set & Function]({% post_url 2024-02-23-set-and-function %})


The entire purpose of this course is to prove that two topological spaces are structurally identical. Specifically, we will prove that the middle-thirds Cantor topological space, endowed with the subspace topology, is homeomorphic to the countable product of the set $$\{0, 1\}$$, endowed with the discrete topology.
