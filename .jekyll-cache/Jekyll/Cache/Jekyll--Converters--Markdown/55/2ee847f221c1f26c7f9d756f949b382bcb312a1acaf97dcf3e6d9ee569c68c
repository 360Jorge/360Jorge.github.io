<p>Hello, fellow math enthusiasts! My name is Jorge, and last semester, I had the unique opportunity to dive into the world of topology through an inquiry-based learning approach in my introduction to topology class. This method was a game-changer for me, as it emphasized exploration and discovery, allowing us to develop our own understanding of complex concepts through guided problem-solving and collaboration.</p>

<p>Throughout the semester, we tackled a variety of fundamental topics in topology, such as topological spaces, bijective functions, compactness, Hausdorff spaces, and homeomorphisms. Our ultimate goal was to prove a fascinating and elegant result: the homeomorphism between the Cantor Set and the discrete product topology on a countably infinite set.</p>

<p>This journey was not only intellectually stimulating but also incredibly rewarding. As a class, we collectively wrote a book comprising around 80 pages of proofs and insights we developed along the way. Now, Iâ€™d like to share this enriching experience with you through this blog post. Iâ€™ll provide an overview of the essential concepts we covered and walk you through the proof of the homeomorphism between the Cantor Set and the discrete product topology.</p>

<p>Whether youâ€™re a fellow student, a teacher, or simply someone with a curiosity for mathematics, I hope this post will offer you valuable insights and perhaps even inspire you to explore the beauty of topology further. Letâ€™s dive in!</p>

<h2 id="background-concepts">Background Concepts</h2>

<h4 id="topological-spaces">Topological Spaces</h4>

<p>A topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a set $X$ and a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ satisfying the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Both $\varnothing$ and $X$ belong to $\mathcal{T}$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If $A$ and $B$ are in $\mathcal{T}$, then $A \cap B$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If $\Lambda$ is an indexing set, and if $A_\alpha$ is in $\mathcal{T}$ for each $\alpha \in \Lambda$, then $\bigcup_{\alpha\in \Lambda} A_\alpha$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="bijective-functions">Bijective Functions</h4>

<h6 id="injective">Injective</h6>

<p>Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be a function. We say $f$ is an injection provided for all $x_1$ and $x_2$ $\in A$, if $x_1 \neq x_2$, then $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2).$ For proofs, it is easier to use the contrapositive form. Thus, if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $x_1 = x_2.$</p>

<h6 id="surjective">Surjective</h6>

<p>Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be a function. We say $f$ is a surjection provided for every $b \in B$, there exists $a \in A$ so that $f(a) = b.$</p>

<h6 id="bijective">Bijective</h6>

<p>We say $f$ is a bijection provided it is a surjection and an injection.</p>

<h4 id="compactness">Compactness</h4>

<h6 id="definition">Definition:</h6>

<p>Let $\Lambda$ be an indexing set, and let $\Phi = \{ A_\alpha \mid \alpha \in \Lambda \}$
 be a collection of sets. Then $\Phi$ is a cover of the set $Y$ if</p>

\[Y\subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha\in \Lambda} A_\alpha.\]

<p>Any subcollection of $\Phi$ that also covers $Y$ is called a subcover.</p>

<h6 id="definition-1">Definition:</h6>

<p>Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $Y\subseteq X.$ A cover $\Phi$ of $Y$ is called an <code class="highlighter-rouge">open cover</code> of $Y$ if each member of $\Phi$ is an open subset of $X$.</p>

<h6 id="definition-2">Definition</h6>

<p>Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $K\subseteq X.$ We say that $K$ is <code class="highlighter-rouge">compact</code> if every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover.</p>

<h4 id="hausdorff-spaces">Hausdorff Spaces</h4>

<p>Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. The space $X$ is called a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hausdorff space</code> (or a $T_2$-space) if, for each pair of distinct elements $x$ and $y$ of $X$, there are disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \in U$ and $y \in V.$</p>

<h4 id="homeomorphism">Homeomorphism</h4>

<p>Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ and $(Y,\mathcal{S})$ be topological spaces, and let $f: X\rightarrow Y.$ We say that $f$ is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">homeomorphism</code> if the following hold.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>$f$ is bijective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-cantor-set">The Cantor Set</h2>

<h4 id="construction">Construction</h4>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set"><img src="/assets/images/Cantor_set_in_seven_iterations.svg.png" alt="cantor set for broken image https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set" /></a></p>

<p>The Cantor Set is constructed through an iterative process of removing middle thirds from the interval $[0, 1].$ Hereâ€™s how the construction proceeds:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Start with the closed interval $[0, 1].$</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove the open middle third of the interval $[0, 1],$ which is $(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}).$ This leaves two closed intervals $[0, \frac{1}{3}]$, and $[\frac{2}{3}, 1].$</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continue this process indefinitely. At each step, remove the open middle third of every ramining interval.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The Cantor Set is the set of points that remain after infinitely many such steps. It can also be described as the set of all points in $[0, 1]$ that have ternary expansions (base $3$) consisting only of the digits $0$ and $2.$ For example, the number $\frac{1}{3}$ in base $3$ is $0.1,$ which is not in the Cantor Set. However, $\frac{1}{4}$ has a ternary expansion $0.020202â€¦,$ which belongs to the Cantor Set.</p>

<h4 id="properties">Properties</h4>

<p>The Cantor Set is compact. This follows from the fact that it is a closed subset of the compact space $[0, 1].$ By the Heine-Borel theorem, a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. The Cantor Set meets both criteria.</p>

<h2 id="discrete-product-topology">Discrete Product Topology</h2>

<h5 id="product-topology">Product Topology</h5>

<p>Let $\Lambda$ be an indexing set, and for each $\alpha \in \Lambda$, let $(X_\alpha, \mathcal{T}_\alpha)$ be a topological space. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">product topology</code> on the Cartesian product is the topology generated by the basis of sets of the form</p>

\[\displaystyle \prod_{\alpha\in \Lambda} U_\alpha,\]

<p>where $U_\alpha$ is open in $X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha\in \Lambda,$ and $U_\alpha=X_\alpha$ except for finitely many indices $\alpha.$</p>

<h4 id="definition-3">Definition</h4>

<p>To understand the discrete product topology, we first need to define the basic building blocks involved. Letâ€™s consider the set $\{0, 1\}.$</p>

<p>Now, letâ€™s extend this idea to the infinite product of these sets. The set $\prod_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \{0,1\}$ represents all possible sequences where each term in the sequence is either $0$ or $1.$</p>

<p>The discrete product topology on $\prod_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \{0,1\}$ is the topology where the basis for open sets is formed by all possible products of open sets in $\{0, 1\},$ where $\{0, 1\}$ itself is given the discrete topology.</p>

<h4 id="properties-1">Properties</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The basis for the discrete topology $X=\prod_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \{0,1\}$ consists of all sets of the form $\mathcal{U}=\prod_{i=1}^\infty U_i,$ where $U_i$ is open in $X_i$ for each $i \in \mathbb{N}$ and $U_i = \{0, 1\}$ except for finitely many indices. Each factor space $U_i$ is either $U_i=\{0,1\}$ or $U_i=\{0\}$ or $U_i=\{1\}$ or $U_i=\emptyset$. (If $U_i=\emptyset$ for any $i\in \mathbb{N},$ then $\mathcal{U}=\emptyset.$)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$\prod_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \{0,1\}$ is a Hausdorff space. This property is significant because it ensures that points in $\prod_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \{0,1\}$ can be separated by open sets.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We will use the next theorem to prove the homeomorphism between the Cantor Set and the discrete product topology:</p>

<h5 id="theorem">Theorem:</h5>

<p>A continuous bijection from a compact space onto a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.</p>

<h5 id="proof">Proof</h5>

<p>Let $X$ be a compact space and let $Y$ be a Hausdorff space.  Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a continuous bijection of $X$ onto $Y.$  We need only show that $f^{-1}:Y\rightarrow X$ is continuous. Let $C\subseteq X$ be closed.  Since $X$ is compact, and since closed subsets of compact spaces are compact, it follows that $C$ is compact.  Since the continuous image of a compact set is compact, we must have $f(C)$ is compact in $Y.$  Since a compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed, we see that $f(C)$ is closed.  Hence $(f^{-1})^{-1}(C)=f(C)$ is closed, and thus $f^{-1}$ is continuous.</p>

<h3 id="theorem-1">Theorem:</h3>

<p>For each $n \in \mathbb{N},$ let $X_n=\{0,2\},$ and endow $X_n$ with the discrete topology. Put $X = \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} X_n,$ and endow $X$ with the product topology $T.$  Endow the Cantor set, $\mathcal{C},$ with the topology $S$ it inherits as a subspace of $[0,1].$  Then $(\mathcal{C},S) \simeq (X,T).$</p>

<h1 id="proof-1">Proof</h1>

<p>Observe that if $x=0.x_1x_2x_3\ldots\in \mathcal{C},$ then this number has a unique ternary expansion such that $x_k\in {0,2}$ for all $k\in \mathbb{N}.$  Henceforth we will assume this ternary expansion for all $x\in \mathcal{C}$.</p>

<p>Define a function $f:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow X$ by 
  $f(0.x_1x_2x_3\ldots)=(x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots).$  We claim that $f$ is a bijection.  Let $f(x)=f(y)$ for some $x,y\in \mathcal{C}.$  Since two sequences are equal if and only if each of their corresponding entries are equal, it follows that $x_i=y_i$ for each $i\in \mathbb{N}.$  Hence \(x=0.x_1x_2x_3\ldots=0.y_1y_2y_3\ldots=y.\)  Now let $y=(x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots)\in X.$  Then for $x=(0.x_1x_2x_3\ldots)\in \mathcal{C}$ we have $f(x)=y.$  Thus $f$ is bijective as claimed.</p>

<p>We claim that $\mathcal{C}$ is compact.  At each stage of construction of the middle-thirds Cantor set, a union of open intervals is subtracted from $[0,1].$  Thus for each $n\in \mathbb{N},$ we have that $C_n$ is closed.  Since the intersection of arbitrarily many closed sets is closed in a topological space, it follows that $\mathcal{C}=\cap_{i=1}^\infty C_n$ is closed.  The interval $[0,1]$ bounds $\mathcal{C}$, so we infer from the Heine-Borel Theorem that $\mathcal{C}$ is compact.</p>

<p>We claim that $X$ is Hausdorff.  Under the discrete topology, any two distinct points $x$ and $y$ can be separated by the open sets $\{x\}$ and $\{y\}$, so $X_n=\{0,2\}$ is Hausdorff for each $n\in \mathbb{N}.$  From a theorem, we see that $X$ must be Hausdorff as well.</p>

<p>Finally, we claim that $f$ is continuous.  Let $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and let $p_n:X\rightarrow X_n$ be the projection onto the $n$-th factor space in $X$.  By a theorem, it suffices to show that $p\circ f:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow X_n$ is continuous.  Let $\epsilon&gt;0$ and set $\delta=\frac{1}{3^n}.$  Suppose that $|x-y|&lt;\delta$ for two elements $x,y\in X_n.$   Then $x$ and $y$ are equal in their $n$-th decimal places, so we have
  \(|p(f(x))-p(f(y))|=|x_n-y_n|=0&lt;\epsilon.\)
  Therefore $f$ is continuous.</p>

<p>Since $f$ is a continuous bijection from a compact space into a Hausdorff space, it follows that $f$ is a homeomorphism.  Therefore, 
  $(\mathcal{C},S)\simeq (X,T)$.</p>
