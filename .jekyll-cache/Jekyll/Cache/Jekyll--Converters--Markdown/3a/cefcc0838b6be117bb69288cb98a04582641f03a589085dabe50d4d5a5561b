I"È<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I am interested in the bridge between pure mathematics and its applications to the real world. I usually find myself switching between the two. Some days I enjoy redoing proofs of some theorems I learn in class, othres I enjoing coding. As an applied math major at GGC, I am required to work on some kind of research before I graduate. I am currently taking classes in Real Analysis, and Topology which is going to be helpful since I want to do my research in Topological Data Analysis. As I read papers, and books to better understand what is going on between packages such scikit-TDA in python, I constantly found words such as simplicial complexes, point cloud data, Cech complex, Rips complex, and persisten homology. In this post I am going to start writing what I have learn so far. Since I am still learning, I might make some mistakes that I will fix as I learn more, and if I feel the post starts making too long, or some parts need more detail explanations, I will break it down into smaller posts. Also, what better way to see what I know and what I dont by writing it down. Also, to give back to the community.</p>

<h2 id="simplicial-complexes">Simplicial Complexes</h2>

<h4 id="simplices">Simplices</h4>

<p>In simple words, a simplex is a generalization of a triangle. A $0$-simplex is a point, a $1$-simplex is a line, a $2$-simplex is a triangle, and a $3$-simplex is a tetrahedron, and it goes up to more dimesions that is harder to visualize.</p>

<h4 id="convex-set">Convex Set</h4>

<p>A set $A$ is convex means if $x, y \in A$, then $\overline{xy} \in A$.</p>

<h4 id="convex-hull">Convex Hull</h4>

<p>A set $A$ is the convex hull of a set $X$ if $A$ is the smallest convex set covering $X$. In other words,</p>

<p>$A$ is convex</p>

<p>$X \subseteq A$ (covering)</p>

<p>If $B$ is a convex covering $X$, then $A \subseteq B$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A $k$-simplex is the convex hull of a $k+1$ vertices.</p>
