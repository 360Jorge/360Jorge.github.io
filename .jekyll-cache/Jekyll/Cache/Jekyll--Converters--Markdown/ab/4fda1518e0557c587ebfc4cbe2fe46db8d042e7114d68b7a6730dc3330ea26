<p>Ever since I finished high school, I knew I wanted to pursue research. I was fascinated by how theoretical physicists could understand the Universe using only paper, a pencil, and some thinking. Initially, I aspired to become a physicist, but I grew disinterested because of the way the subject was taught. Despite my lack of enthusiasm, I continued attending college, but I decided to explore topics on my own. It was during this time that I realized my passion for mathematics, but I yearned to witness its real-world applications. Since my college experience didn’t provide the practical aspect I craved, I sought it online. There, I became captivated by how equations and ideas came to life through software.</p>

<p>This is a brief account of my journey so far. It hasn’t been easy, and I’ve made mistakes along the way, but I cannot change the past. Currently, I am attending Georgia Gwinnett College, and I’m only a year and a half away from graduation. The upcoming semester is crucial because it will bring me close to conducting research, and so, I wanted to document all my experiences and learnings. That’s the primary purpose of this blog.</p>

<p>I am using Jekyll, and the thinkSpace theme for my blog. While learning on my own, I learned some web programming, and so I feel enough confidence to set up a simple static website using GitHub Pages. I also add latex support. The next part is just for testing:</p>

<h5 id="this-is-some-latex">This is some latex:</h5>

<p>The Lagrangian equation of motion is a fundamental equation in classical mechanics that describes the dynamics of a system based on its Lagrangian function.</p>

<p>The Lagrangian function, denoted by L, is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy “T” and potential energy “V” of a system:</p>

<p>L = T - V</p>

<p>The Lagrangian equation of motion is derived from the principle of least action, which states that the true path taken by a system between two points in time
is the one the minimizes the action integral along the path.</p>

<p>The action integral “S” is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian function over time “t” from the initial time “t1” to the final time “t2”:</p>

\[S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L\, dt\]

<p>The Lagrangian equation of motion is expressed as follows:</p>

\[\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_i}} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = 0\]

<p>In this equation, the term \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_i}}\) is called the generalized momentum, and \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}\) is called the generalized force.</p>
