<p>Since I finish high school, I knew I wanted to research. I was fascinated by how theoretical physicists could understand the Universe
with just paper, a pencil, and some thinking. I wanted to be a physicist, but I soon got bored because of the way it was taught. Though I kept going to college
I was not enthusiastics on going, and I started to learn things on my own. And then, I realized that though I found the math fascinating, I needed more. I wanted to see
the math working in the real world. And since I couldnt find that in college, I found it online. I was hooked by how those equations, and ideas came to life through
software.</p>

<p>That is a short paragraph on how I got here. It is not been easy, and I also made a lot of mistakes. But those are things I cannot change. Anyways, I am currently going to Georgia Gwinnett college, and I am a year and half away from graduation. The next semester is going to be an important one because I will have a close expereience to
making research, and I wanted to record everything I do and learn, and that is the main reason of this blog.</p>

<p>I am using jekyll, and the thinkSpace theme. While learning on my own, I learn some web programming, and so I feel enough confidence to set up a simple static website
using github pages. I also add latex support. The next part is just for testing:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"Python syntax highlighting"</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">s</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is some latex:</p>

<p>In this equation, the term \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_i}}\) is called the generalized momentum, and \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}\) is called the generalized force.</p>

<p>Schrödinger equation:</p>

\[i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \Psi + V\Psi\]
