<p>The middle-thirds Cantor topological space, endowed with the subspace topology, is homeomorphic to the countable product of the set \(\{0, 1\}\), endowed with the discrete topology.</p>

<p>Proving the above fact is the purpose of my topology class. We are writing a book <a href="/2024/set-and-function/">Set &amp; Function</a></p>

<p>The entire purpose of this course is to prove that two topological spaces are structurally identical. Specifically, we will prove that the middle-thirds Cantor topological space, endowed with the subspace topology, is homeomorphic to the countable product of the set \(\{0, 1\}\), endowed with the discrete topology.</p>
