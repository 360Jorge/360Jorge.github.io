I"<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I am interested in the bridge between pure mathematics and its applications to the real world. I usually find myself switching between the two. Some days I enjoy redoing proofs of some theorems I learn in class, othres I enjoing coding. As an applied math major at GGC, I am required to work on some kind of research before I graduate. I am currently taking classes in Real Analysis, and Topology which is going to be helpful since I want to do my research in Topological Data Analysis. As I read papers, and books to better understand what is going on between packages such scikit-TDA in python, I constantly found words such as simplicial complexes, point cloud data, Cech complex, Rips complex, and persisten homology. In this post I am going to start writing what I have learn so far. Since I am still learning, I might make some mistakes that I will fix as I learn more, and if I feel the post starts making too long, or some parts need more detail explanations, I will break it down into smaller posts. Also, what better way to see what I know and what I dont by writing it down. Also, to give back to the community.</p>

<h2 id="simplicial-complexes">Simplicial Complexes</h2>

<h4 id="simplices">Simplices</h4>

<p>In simple words, a simplex is a generalization of a triangle. A $0$-simplex is a point, a $1$-simplex is a line, a $2$-simplex is a triangle, and a $3$-simplex is a tetrahedron, and it goes up to more dimesions that is harder to visualize.</p>

<h4 id="convex-set">Convex Set</h4>

<p>A set $A$ is convex means if $x, y \in A$, then $\overline{xy} \in A$.</p>

<h4 id="convex-hull">Convex Hull</h4>

<p>A set $A$ is the convex hull of a set $X$ if $A$ is the smallest convex set covering $X$. In other words,</p>

<p>$A$ is convex</p>

<p>$X \subseteq A$ (covering)</p>

<p>If $B$ is a convex covering $X$, then $A \subseteq B$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A $k$-simplex is the convex hull of $k+1$ vertices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, before I write the definiton of a simplicial complex, I will write the definition of a face of a k-simplex.</p>

<h4 id="face-of-a-k-simplex">Face of a k-simplex</h4>

<p>A face of a $k$-simplex is a sub-simplex. For instace, take a $2$-simplex (a triangle)</p>

<p>In the image, we have 3 $0$-faces ($v_0, v_1, v_2$), 3 $1$-faces $e_0 = [v_0, v_1]$, $e_1 = [v_1, v_2]$, and $e_2 = [v_0, v_2]$, and 1 $2$-face $S_0 = [e_0, e_1, e_2]$.</p>

<p>I will now write the definiton of a simplicial compelex.</p>

<h4 id="simplicial-complex">Simplicial Complex</h4>

<p>A simplicial complex $\Sigma$ is a union of simplices such that</p>

<p>If $\sigma$ is a simplex in $\Sigma$, then each face of $\sigma$ is a simplex in $\Sigma$.</p>

<p>If $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ are simplices in $\Sigma$, then $\sigma_1 \cap \sigma_2$ is a simplex in $\Sigma$.</p>
