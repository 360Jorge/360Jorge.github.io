<p>Ever since I finished high school, I knew I wanted to pursue research. I was fascinated by how theoretical physicists could understand the Universe using only paper, a pencil, and some thinking. Initially, I aspired to become a physicist, but I grew disinterested because of the way the subject was taught. Despite my lack of enthusiasm, I continued attending college, but I decided to explore topics on my own. It was during this time that I realized my passion for mathematics, but I yearned to witness its real-world applications. Since my college experience didnâ€™t provide the practical aspect I craved, I sought it online. There, I became captivated by how equations and ideas came to life through software.</p>

<p>This is a brief account of my journey so far. It hasnâ€™t been easy, and Iâ€™ve made mistakes along the way, but I cannot change the past. Currently, I am attending Georgia Gwinnett College, and Iâ€™m only a year and a half away from graduation. The upcoming semester is crucial because it will bring me close to conducting research, and so, I wanted to document all my experiences and learnings. Thatâ€™s the primary purpose of this blog.</p>

<p>I am using jekyll, and the thinkSpace theme for my blog. While learning on my own, I learn some web programming, and so I feel enough confidence to set up a simple static website
using github pages. I also add latex support. The next part is just for testing:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"Python syntax highlighting"</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">s</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is some latex:</p>

<p>In this equation, the term \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_i}}\) is called the generalized momentum, and \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}\) is called the generalized force.</p>

<p>SchrÃ¶dinger equation:</p>

\[i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \Psi + V\Psi\]
